##### What is SMART
Smart provides a lightweight Java web framework and some libraries (plugins and modules). The framework includes [IOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee), [AOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_oxidation_process), [DAO](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DAO.html), [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping),[MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) technologies, and the plugins can enhance to the framework and the modules can be reuseful for any other applications. Smart can improve your work efficiency and make your development easy.

- IOC   

IOC (Inversion of control) is a general parent term while DI (Dependency injection) is a subset of IOC. IOC is a concept where the flow of application is inverted. So for example rather than the caller calling the method. Hide Copy Code.
- AOP   

AOP (Aspect-oriented programming) is an approach to programming that allows global properties of a program to determine how it is compiled into an executable program. AOP can be used with object-oriented programming (AOP). An aspect is a subprogram that is associated with a specific property of a program.
- DAO   

DAO (Data access object) is an object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, 
- ORM   

ORM (Object-relational mapping) is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language
- MVC   

MVC (Model View Controller) is one of three ASP.NET programming models. MVC is a framework for building web
applications using a MVC design: The Model represents the application core (for instance a list of database records). The View displays the data (the database records).
